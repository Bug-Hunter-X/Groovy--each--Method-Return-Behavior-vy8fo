This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in Groovy's `each` method.  The `return` statement within the closure of `each` doesn't halt iteration; it only exits the closure's execution. This can lead to unexpected results, especially when handling null values or conditional checks. The solution showcases how to properly use `each` or alternative methods like `find` to achieve the desired behavior.
